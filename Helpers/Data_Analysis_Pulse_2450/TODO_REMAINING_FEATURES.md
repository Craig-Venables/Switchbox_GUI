## üìù IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### File Format Parsers Needed

1. **PMU Simple**: 
   - No header, start reading from line 1
   - Tab or space delimited
   - Auto-detect from column count and headers

2. **Endurance**:
   - Header row with column names
   - Extract cycles and resistance states
   - Need special plotting for HRS/LRS

3. **IV Sweep**:
   - Voltage-Current data
   - Detect hysteresis from forward/reverse
   - Calculate parameters (Vset, Vreset, etc.)

### Statistics Calculations

- Use `numpy` for basic stats
- Use `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` for exponential fits
- Relaxation time: fit R(t) = R‚àû + (R‚ÇÄ - R‚àû)e^(-t/œÑ)

### Multi-Axis Implementation

- Use matplotlib's `twinx()` for dual Y-axis
- Keep separate line collections
- Handle zoom/pan synchronization
