# Plotting demo – reproducible example graphs

This folder generates **example plots for each subsection** (core, device, sample, section, endurance) using **deterministic synthetic data** so the same data is used every run. Use it to see how changes to style or plotting code affect the graphs.

## How to run

From the **project root** (the directory that contains `plotting/`):

```bash
py plotting/demo/run_all.py
```

or:

```bash
python plotting/demo/run_all.py
```

Outputs are written to:

- `plotting/demo/output/core/`
- `plotting/demo/output/device/`
- `plotting/demo/output/sample/`
- `plotting/demo/output/section/`
- `plotting/demo/output/endurance/`

## Data

All data is generated by `synthetic_data.py` with a **fixed random seed** (42), so runs are reproducible. No external data files are required.

To use your own data later, you can add files under `demo/data/` and extend `synthetic_data.py` (or a small loader) to read from them when present. See `data/README.md` for expected formats.

## What gets generated

| Subsection | Contents |
|------------|----------|
| **core** | One figure using `style` and `plain_log_formatter` so changes to core affect the look. |
| **device** | IV dashboard, conduction analysis, SCLC fit, and a concentration-yield scatter (HDF5-style). |
| **sample** | Memristivity heatmap, conduction mechanisms, classification scatter. |
| **section** | Sweeps-by-type combined plot and statistical comparison plots. |
| **endurance** | Current vs cycle (per voltage) and endurance summary. |

This is for **development and regression comparison**, not production.
