# SampleGUI Visual Design Summary

The SampleGUI is a Tkinter-based application with a clean, modern interface using a light theme. The main window is 1000x850 pixels with a three-tier layout: a top control bar, a tabbed notebook in the middle, and a bottom status bar. The top control bar contains horizontal dropdowns (Multiplexer, Sample Type, Section, Device) styled with ttk.Combobox widgets, plus a prominent green "Measure" button (#4CAF50 background, white text, bold Segoe UI font) that dynamically shows the selected device count. The primary typography uses Segoe UI (9-12pt) for labels and buttons, with Consolas (9pt) for terminal output. The main content area uses a ttk.Notebook with three tabs: "Device Selection", "Device Manager", and "Quick Scan Results". The Device Selection tab features a 600x500 white canvas with black border for device map visualization, flanked by a scrollable device list panel with checkboxes and colored status icons (green ✓ for working, red ✗ for broken, gray ? for undefined). Navigation controls include Previous/Next buttons, an info box with gray background (#f0f0f0), and Route/Clear buttons. The terminal log uses a dark theme (#1e1e1e background, #d4d4d4 text) with color-coded messages (blue for info #569CD6, green for success #4CAF50, orange for warnings #FFA500, red for errors #F44336). The bottom status bar displays connection status in green (#4CAF50) or red (#F44336), device counts, and a theme indicator. Overlays on the canvas use semi-transparent gradients (red-to-green for quick scan results, solid green/red for manual status). All frames use ttk.LabelFrame with raised relief and standard padding. The overall aesthetic is professional and functional with consistent gray accents (#888888) for secondary text and a light gray (#f0f0f0) for info boxes.
