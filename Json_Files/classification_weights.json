    "notes": {
        "memristive": "Scores for devices showing SINGLE pinched loop (ONE zero crossing) + switching behavior. Pinched hysteresis = figure-8 with lobes meeting at origin. v1.3: +20 bonus for switching+nonlinearity combination. Switching is THE defining memristive feature.",
        "capacitive": "Scores for devices with unpinched hysteresis, phase shift, and elliptical patterns (pure capacitive, no memory)",
        "memcapacitive": "CORRECTED v1.4: Memcapacitors show DOUBLE zero crossing (TWO crossings per cycle) - butterfly/horizontal figure-8 pattern. This is charge-dependent capacitance. Primary signature (50 pts): double_zero_crossing. Penalty -30 for single pinched crossing (that's memristive, not memcapacitive!). Strong switching penalty (-25) still applies.",
        "conductive": "Scores for non-linear devices without hysteresis (non-ohmic, non-memristive)",
        "ohmic": "Enhanced graduated scoring system: ohmic_strong (80) for perfect ohmic, ohmic_clear (70), ohmic_with_artifact (60) for linear with weak hysteresis, ohmic_weak (40) for marginal cases. Legacy weights preserved for compatibility.",
        "penalties": "Negative scores to prevent misclassification. Critical: memristive_penalty_no_switching (-40) prevents devices with hysteresis but NO switching from being classified as memristive.",
        "adaptive_thresholds": "v1.3+: Area thresholds scale with current magnitude (sqrt scaling) to handle devices from 1e-9 to 1e-3 A. Pinched check relaxed to 10% for switching devices to handle non-ideal zero crossing.",
        "zero_crossing_distinction": "v1.4: CRITICAL DISTINCTION - Memristive: ONE crossing (pinched at origin), Memcapacitive: TWO crossings (double crossing pattern). This properly distinguishes resistance-based from charge-based memory."

    "changelog": {
        "v1.0": "Initial classification weights",
        "v1.1": "Fixed ohmic device misclassification: (1) Increased ohmic weights 60→90, 20→30, (2) Strengthened memristive penalties -20→-40, -30→-50, (3) Added ohmic guard in classification logic, (4) Fixed pinched hysteresis false positives",
        "v1.2": "Major enhancement to ohmic classification: (1) NEW graduated ohmic scoring system with 4 quality levels (strong/clear/artifact/weak), (2) NEW memristive_penalty_no_switching (-40) for devices with hysteresis but no switching/nonlinearity, (3) Enhanced artifact filtering in pinched hysteresis detection with minimum area requirement, (4) Improved hysteresis presence detection with multi-level thresholds (1e-4 to 1e-2) and consistency checks, (5) Added artifact detection logic for linear+pinched+no_switching cases",
        "v1.3": "CRITICAL FIX for memristive vs memcapacitive competition: (1) NEW memristive_switching_plus_nonlinear_bonus (+20) - if device has BOTH switching AND nonlinearity, strongly favor memristive classification, (2) NEW memcapacitive_penalty_strong_switching (-25) - strong switching (ON/OFF > 2) is memristive, not memcapacitive, (3) ADAPTIVE area thresholds now scale with current magnitude using sqrt(I/1mA) to handle devices from 1e-9 to 1e-3 A, (4) Relaxed pinched hysteresis check to 10% (from 5%) for switching devices to handle non-ideal zero crossing due to series resistance, (5) Adaptive minimum area for pinched check (10x more lenient for switching devices)",
        "v1.4": "FUNDAMENTAL CORRECTION to memcapacitive classification logic: (1) NEW _check_double_zero_crossing() - detects TWO zero crossings per cycle (memcapacitive fingerprint), (2) NEW memcapacitive_double_zero_crossing (+50) - PRIMARY memcapacitive signature, (3) NEW memcapacitive_elliptical (+15) - elliptical pattern support, (4) CORRECTED logic: Memcapacitors have DOUBLE crossing (butterfly/horizontal figure-8), NOT unpinched hysteresis, (5) Increased memcapacitive_penalty_pinched to -30 (from -20) - single pinch is memristive!, (6) Reduced memcapacitive_hysteresis_unpinched to 20 (from 40) - de-emphasized legacy logic, (7) Updated classification notes to clarify: ONE crossing = memristive, TWO crossings = memcapacitive"
