## Measurement Types

- DC Triangle IV: Classic FS/PS/NS triangle sweep. Configurable by Sweep Mode (fixed step, fixed sweep rate, fixed voltage time), Sweep Type (FS/PS/NS), Step/Delay or rate/time.

- SMU Pulsed IV: One pulse per amplitude across a range; device returns to Vbase and a read is taken. Use when you want reduced self-heating compared with DC IV.

- SMU Fast Pulses: Pulse train at fixed amplitude and width; measure at Vbase after each pulse. Good for endurance-like stress.

- SMU Fast Hold: Hold a DC bias and sample current vs time (I–t). Useful for stress/recovery or quick retention checks.

- ISPP: Incremental Step Pulse Programming. Increase pulse amplitude stepwise until hitting a target current/resistance. Produces amplitude vs response curves.

- Pulse Width Sweep: Fixed amplitude, sweep pulse width; read at Vbase; width vs response.

- Threshold Search: Find Vset/Vreset using binary/gradient search with minimal pulses.

## Safety & Limits

- SMU-specific minimum pulse width enforced via SMULimits. Defaults are set per model (e.g., 2400/2401 ≥ 1 ms).
- Planned: optional guard to abort on excessive current jump between samples.

## Timing and "Fast" Pulses

SMU-driven pulses are limited by instrument command latency and OS scheduling; they are appropriate for millisecond-scale pulses, not microseconds.

- SMU limits: `SMULimits.min_pulse_width_ms` enforces device-specific minima (e.g., 2400/2401 ≥ 1 ms). Sub-ms accuracy requires a PMU.
- Implementation details:
  - `MeasurementService.run_pulse_measurement` sets the pulse voltage, then busy-waits the pulse duration using ~1 ms sleeps, returns to Vbase, waits ~2 ms for settling, then reads.
  - Inter-pulse delay is user-configurable; "Max speed" can set it to 0, bounded by device limits.
- Python/OS timing: `time.sleep(0.001)` is not hard real-time; actual resolution and jitter depend on the OS scheduler (on Windows typically ~1 ms best case). Expect a few ms of timing uncertainty on SMU pulses.
- Recommendation: For sub-ms or waveform-accurate pulses, use the PMU flows (see PMU_Testing_GUI and PMU_* methods in `measurement_service.py`).

## Specific Measurements
### Volatile
- Transient Decay: single pulse then sample I(t) at Vread (extract τ / power-law).
  Sketch: `|‾‾|____` then hold Vread → I(t) decays.
- PPF: two identical pulses separated by Δt; PPF index vs Δt.
  Sketch: `|‾‾|__Δt__|‾‾|` → measure I1 and I2 @ Vread; PPF=(I2−I1)/|I1|.
- STDP: pre/post pulses with Δt (±); Δw vs Δt curve.
- SRDP: trains at different frequencies; steady-state/current gain vs rate.
- Potentiation/Depression: alternating +/− short pulses; immediate and post-delay reads; volatility ratio.
- Frequency Response: sweep pulse frequency (fixed width/amplitude); response vs frequency.
- Dynamic Threshold (volatile): minimal pulse amplitude/width that elicits transient change (binary/gradient).
- Bias-dependent Volatility: repeat transients at multiple Vread; map decay constants vs bias.
- Temperature-dependent Volatility: repeat at several temperatures; Arrhenius for decay time (future).
- Noise/RTN: low-bias I(t) segments for PSD/variance.

### Nonvolatile
- (reserved for future: long retention, endurance, MLC program/verify, half-select disturb, etc.)

## Custom Sweeps

- Each sweep can set a `measurement type` within the GUI. For custom JSON, an `excitation` key enables pulse modes (examples provided in `Json_Files/Custom_Sweeps.json`).

## Signal Messaging
- Optional Telegram bot integration to drive interactive flows (start/continue tests, send plots/images).

## TSP Testing System (Keithley 2450)

- **Controller**: `Equipment/SMU_AND_PMU/Keithley2450_TSP.py` (TSP command interface)
- **Test Scripts**: `Equipment/SMU_AND_PMU/keithley2450_tsp_scripts.py` (pre-configured test patterns)
- **GUI**: `TSP_Testing_GUI.py` (fast pulse testing with real-time visualization)

### Features

- **Front/Rear Terminal Selection**: Toggle between front panel and rear BNC terminals via radio buttons in the connection section. Default selection is automatically saved and restored on next startup.

- **Fast On-Instrument Execution**: All test scripts run entirely on the instrument (no PC communication during tests), enabling sub-millisecond pulse generation with high timing accuracy.

- **Buffer-Based Measurements**: All measurements use instrument buffers for fast, accurate data collection with proper timestamp handling.

- **Correct Setting Order**: All functions follow Keithley manual specifications (measure function/range set first, then source settings) to prevent errors 5076/5077.

### Available Test Patterns

- **Pulse-Read-Repeat**: (Pulse → Read → Delay) × N cycles
- **Multi-Pulse-Then-Read**: (Pulse×N → Read×M) × Cycles
- **Varying Width Pulses**: Sweep different pulse widths
- **Potentiation/Depression**: Gradual SET/RESET cycles
- **Endurance Test**: (SET → Read → RESET → Read) × N cycles
- **Retention Test**: Pulse followed by timed reads
- **Relaxation Tests**: Multi-pulse with relaxation monitoring
- **Width Sweeps**: Systematic pulse width characterization
- **Current Range Finder**: Test multiple current ranges to find optimal measurement range

### Terminal Configuration

- **Front Panel**: Standard front binding posts (FORCE HI/LO, SENSE HI/LO)
- **Rear Panel**: BNC connectors for remote connections
  - **Force HI**: Source positive (BNC center)
  - **Force LO**: Source return (BNC center)
  - **Sense HI**: Voltage sense positive (BNC center)
  - **Sense LO**: Voltage sense negative (BNC center)
- Terminal selection persists until changed and is saved as default preference

## PMU System (current capabilities)

- Controller: `Equipment/SMU_AND_PMU/Keithley4200A.py` (`Keithley4200A_PMUDualChannel` low-level helper)
- Service: `Measurments/measurement_services_pmu.py` (`MeasurementServicesPMU` high-level API)
- GUI: `PMU_Testing_GUI.py` (connect PMU + function generator, preview waveforms, run measurement, view results)

- Reference: see `Equipment/SMU_AND_PMU/PMU_Step_Sweep_Reference.md` for PMU step vs sweep and sweep types.

### Available measurement
- Single Laser Pulse with read
  - PMU sources a pulse train; TRIG OUT drives the function generator (FG) which emits a laser pulse.
  - Enforced checks: FG pulse_width_s ≥ PMU active time; safety dialogs require laser OFF (before arming) and ON (before run).
  - Parameters:
    - PMU: amplitude_v, width_s, period_s (or auto via width_s), num_pulses, ranges, measurement window.
    - FG: period_s, high_level_v, cycles, trigger_source=EXT; pulse_width_s auto set to match PMU active time.
  - API entrypoint: `MeasurementServicesPMU.Single_Laser_Pulse_with_read(pmu_params, fg_params)`

## Notes

- PMU-based measurements are available separately (see PMU_Testing_GUI) for accurate waveform capture.
- TSP Testing GUI requires Keithley 2450 to be in TSP mode (not SCPI). Switch via: MENU → System → Settings → Command Set → TSP
- Terminal selection (front/rear) is saved automatically and persists across sessions
- All TSP functions now use correct setting order (measure function/range first) to prevent instrument errors
